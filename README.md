# Fjord

Fjord is a strict functional programming language that compiles to JS. 

## Key Goals

 * Efficiency: Fjord is strictly evaluated and strives to minimize boxing. 
 * Performance: linear types allow for principled mutation, minimizing 
   pressure on the garbage collector.
 * Fast compilation: a project written in Fjord should re-compile in less than a second.
 * Usability: Fjord should be a viable alternative on both the backend and frontend.
